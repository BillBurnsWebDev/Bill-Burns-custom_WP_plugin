Description:

This custom WP plugin is an artifact from the “Web Development with WordPress” course at Highline College in Des Moines, WA (part of the Web & Database Developer certificate curriculum)

The primary class project was creating an e-commerce website using the WooCommerce WP theme “Storefront”.
Creating a custom site-specific WP contact form plugin was offered as an extra credit assignment. We were provided a pre-existing functioning contact form plugin as a template. The assignment consisted of by making minor cosmetic changes and submitting a screenshot.

I opted to re-design the plugin from the ground up using CSS Grid Layout as a primary design element.
